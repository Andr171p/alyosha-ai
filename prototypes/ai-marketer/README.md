Python can be used to create various SEO projects, ranging from simple automation scripts to advanced machine learning models for predictions. 
Here are several Python project ideas for SEO, categorized by their complexity and function:
Beginner Projects (Automation & Auditing)
These projects leverage libraries like Beautiful Soup, requests, and Pandas to automate repetitive tasks. 
Website Content Auditor: A script that crawls a given URL and checks on-page SEO factors.
Features:
Checks for the presence and length of title tags and meta descriptions.
Verifies correct heading hierarchy (H1, H2, etc.).
Identifies images without alt attributes.
Analyzes internal and external link status (e.g., broken links, status codes).
Keyword Density Checker: A script that analyzes the content of a webpage to calculate keyword density and identify areas for improvement.
Sitemap Generator: An automated script to generate or update an XML sitemap for a website.
Image Optimizer: A tool that automatically resizes and optimizes images in bulk for faster page load times, which is a key ranking factor. 
Intermediate Projects (Data Analysis & Keyword Research)
These projects often integrate with APIs or handle larger datasets using libraries like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. 
Keyword Research Tool: A project that uses search engine APIs (e.g., Google Autocomplete, Related Searches, People Also Ask) to generate and extract relevant keyword ideas and save them to a CSV or JSON file.
Competitor Analysis Tool: A script that compares your website's performance metrics against competitors by pulling data from sources like Google PageSpeed Insights.
SEO Reporting Automator: A project that integrates with Google Analytics and Search Console APIs to extract key data and automatically generate insightful reports and visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib.
Backlink Monitor: A script that monitors backlink profiles by periodically checking the status of links from external sites. 
Advanced Projects (Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling)
These projects involve more complex implementation for predictive insights using libraries like Scikit-Learn. 
SEO Performance Predictor: A machine learning model that uses historical data (traffic, keywords, engagement metrics) to forecast future SEO performance.
AI Content Optimization Assistant: A tool that suggests content enhancements based on an analysis of top-ranking competitor pages for a target query, providing recommendations to surpass the competition. 
Key Python Libraries
To get started, you will typically need the following libraries:
requests: for making HTTP requests to fetch webpage content.
BeautifulSoup: for parsing HTML and extracting specific data.
Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: for machine learning projects.
Streamlit: for building a simple web application interface for your tools.
